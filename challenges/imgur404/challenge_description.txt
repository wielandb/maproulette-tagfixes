In this challenge, you remove imgur-Links that no longer lead to an image.
Most probably because they were deleted when imgur removed all links not tied to an account.

The code that generates the tasks can be found [here](https://github.com/wielandb/maproulette-tagfixes/tree/main/challenges/imgur404). The challenge was discussed [here]().
